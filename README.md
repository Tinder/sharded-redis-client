# Sharded Redis Client

## Description

Creates a Redis client that consistently shards by key using sha1

## Usage

### Example 1:
```
const shardedClient = new ShardedRedisClient([{
  host: 'box1.redis',
  port_range: [6370, 6372]
}, {
  host: 'box2.redis',
  port_range: [10000]
}, {
  host: 'box3.redis',
  port_range: [6379, 6380],
  slaveHosts: ['box3.redis.slave1', 'box3.redis.slave2'],
  readPreference: 'slave' // <- force read slave on this set
}]);
```

Represents a 6-client sha1 HashRing in the following order:
```
[
 'box1.redis:6370',
 'box1.redis:6371',
 'box1.redis:6372',
 'box2.redis:10000',
 'box3.redis:6379', // slaves: 'box3.redis.slave1:6379', 'box3.redis.slave2:6379'
 'box3.redis:6380', // slaves: 'box3.redis.slave1:6380', 'box3.redis.slave2:6380'
]
```

### Example 2 (single client):
```
const shardedClient = new ShardedRedisClient([{ host: 'localhost', port_range: [3000] }])
```

Represents a 1-client (unsharded) HashRing that is only useful in development: `['localhost:3000']`

Use with slaves: `shardedClient.slaveOk()`

If a slave doesn't exist for a given client, nothing changes.
Also, `slaveOk()` only affects read-only commands.
